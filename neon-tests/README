The scripts and files in this directory can be used to test the NEON disassembler/assembler.

HOW TO USE
1. Do a checkout of the GCC and/or Valgrind source code.
2. Go to the GCC and/or Valgrind subdirectory and execute the 'generate.sh' script.
    ./generate.sh <path to GCC/Valgrind sources>
   The script will import the testcases from the source directory and modify them if appropriate.
3. In this directory, execute the 'build.sh' script. This can take a long time.
    ./build.sh
